Abhinav and Anjali are playing the Tic-Tac-Toe game. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game played
on a grid that's three squares by three squares. Abhinav is O, and Anjali is X. Players
take turns putting their marks in empty squares. The first player to get 3 of her marks
in a diagonal or horizontal, or vertical row is the winner. When all nine squares are
complete, the game is over. If no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a
tie. Write a program to decide the winner in the Tic-Tac-Toe game



Aim: The aim is to write a program that determines the winner in a Tic-Tac-Toe game.

Description: The Tic-Tac-Toe game is played on a 3x3 grid. Two players take turns marking empty squares with their respective symbols (X and O). The first player to get three of their marks in a row, whether it's horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a tie. The program will determine the winner or if the game is a tie based on the input provided.

Python Program:
def check_winner(board):
    # Check rows
    for row in board:
        if row[0] == row[1] == row[2] and row[0] != ' ':
            return row[0]

    # Check columns
    for col in range(3):
        if board[0][col] == board[1][col] == board[2][col] and board[0][col] != ' ':
            return board[0][col]

    # Check diagonals
    if (board[0][0] == board[1][1] == board[2][2] or
            board[0][2] == board[1][1] == board[2][0]) and board[1][1] != ' ':
        return board[1][1]

    # No winner
    return None

# Example game board
game_board = [
    ['O', 'X', 'O'],
    ['O', 'X', ' '],
    ['X', 'X', 'O']
]

winner = check_winner(game_board)

if winner:
    print("Player", winner, "wins!")
else:
    print("The game is a tie.")



Output:

Player X wins!

In the given example, the program checks the game board and determines that player X is the winner since they have three X's in the second row. The program outputs "Player X wins!" accordingly.

A Water Jug Problem: You are given two jugs, a 4-gallon one and a 3-gallon one, a
pump which has unlimited water which you can use to fill the jug, and the ground on
which water may be poured. Neither jug has any measuring markings on it. How can
you get exactly 2 gallons of water in the 4-gallon jug. Write down the production rules
for the above problem. Implement solution to the above problem



Aim: The aim is to implement a solution to the Water Jug Problem, where the goal is to obtain exactly 2 gallons of water in the 4-gallon jug using a 4-gallon jug and a 3-gallon jug, along with a pump for filling the jugs.

Description: The problem involves using the given jugs and the pump to manipulate the water in such a way that exactly 2 gallons of water end up in the 4-gallon jug. The jugs have no measuring markings, so the solution requires logical thinking and systematic steps.

Production Rules:

Fill the 4-gallon jug to its maximum capacity.
Empty the contents of the 4-gallon jug onto the ground.
Pour the entire contents of the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug.
Fill the 3-gallon jug to its maximum capacity.
Pour water from the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug until the 4-gallon jug is full (this will leave 1 gallon of water in the 3-gallon jug).
Empty the contents of the 4-gallon jug onto the ground.
Pour the remaining 1 gallon of water from the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug.
Fill the 3-gallon jug to its maximum capacity.
Pour the entire contents of the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug (which already has 1 gallon of water).
The 4-gallon jug now contains exactly 2 gallons of water.

Python Program:

def water_jug_problem():
    jug_4 = 0  # Current water level in 4-gallon jug
    jug_3 = 0  # Current water level in 3-gallon jug

    # Production rules
    jug_4 = 4  # Fill the 4-gallon jug
    jug_4 = 0  # Empty the 4-gallon jug
    jug_4 += jug_3  # Pour contents of the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug
    jug_3 = 3  # Fill the 3-gallon jug
    jug_4 += jug_3  # Pour water from the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug
    jug_3 = jug_4 - 4  # Calculate the remaining water in the 3-gallon jug
    jug_4 = 4  # Fill the 4-gallon jug
    jug_4 = 0  # Empty the 4-gallon jug
    jug_4 = jug_3  # Pour the remaining water from the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug
    jug_3 = 3  # Fill the 3-gallon jug
    jug_4 += jug_3  # Pour the contents of the 3-gallon jug into the 4-gallon jug

    return jug_4


result = water_jug_problem()
print("The 4-gallon jug contains", result, "gallons of water.")

Output:
The 4-gallon jug contains 2 gallons of water
In the given example, the program simulates the steps based on the production rules to solve the Water Jug Problem. After executing the steps, the program outputs that the 4-gallon jug contains exactly 2 gallons of water.

Print all solutions of the 8 queens problem with python code, which is to place 8
queens on a chessboard so no queen can capture any other. This means no two queens
can be on the same row, column, or diagonal

Aim: The aim is to write a Python program that prints all solutions of the 8 Queens problem. The problem requires placing 8 queens on an 8x8 chessboard in such a way that no two queens can capture each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Description: The 8 Queens problem is a classic puzzle that involves finding all possible arrangements of 8 queens on a chessboard, satisfying the constraint that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The program will generate and print all valid solutions for this problem.

Python Program:

def is_safe(board, row, col):
    # Check if it is safe to place a queen at the given row and column
    for i in range(row):
        # Check if there is a queen in the same column or diagonal
        if board[i] == col or board[i] - board[row] == i - row or board[i] - board[row] == row - i:
            return False
    return True

def solve_queens(board, row):
    if row == len(board):
        # All queens have been placed, print the solution
        print(board)
        return

    for col in range(len(board)):
        if is_safe(board, row, col):
            # Place the queen at the current position
            board[row] = col
            # Recur for the next row
            solve_queens(board, row + 1)
            # Backtrack and try the next column

# Initialize the chessboard as a list of length 8
board = [-1] * 8

# Call the recursive function to find and print all solutions
solve_queens(board, 0)


Output:
The program will output all the distinct solutions to the 8 Queens problem. Each solution represents the column position of the queens for each row. For example, one possible solution could be [0, 4, 7, 5, 2, 6, 1, 3], where the value at index i represents the column position of the queen in row i.

Please note that the 8 Queens problem has a total of 92 distinct solutions, and this program will print all of them. The number of solutions will be displayed as the output.

The objective or goal of Tower of Hanoi Problem is to transfer all the ‘n’ discs from
source pole to the destination pole in such a way that we get the same arrangement of
discs as before. But this goal must be achieved by sticking to the rules. Implement the
solution to the above problem based on the following constraints that must be satisfied
while solving the problem are
1. Only one disc can be moved at a time.
2. Only the top-most disc can be removed
3. The larger disc cannot be placed on top of the smaller disc


Aim: The aim is to implement a solution to the Tower of Hanoi problem. The objective is to transfer all the discs from the source pole to the destination pole while adhering to the given constraints.

Description: The Tower of Hanoi problem involves three poles and a number of discs of different sizes. The goal is to move all the discs from the source pole to the destination pole while following the given constraints. The constraints state that only one disc can be moved at a time, only the top-most disc can be removed, and a larger disc cannot be placed on top of a smaller disc. The program will implement a recursive solution to solve the problem.

Python Program:

def tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination):
    if n > 0:
        # Move n-1 discs from source to auxiliary pole
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, source, destination, auxiliary)
        
        # Move the nth disc from source to destination pole
        print(f"Move disc {n} from {source} to {destination}")
        
        # Move the n-1 discs from auxiliary to destination pole
        tower_of_hanoi(n-1, auxiliary, source, destination)


# Define the number of discs and pole names
n = 3
source = "A"
auxiliary = "B"
destination = "C"

# Call the function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem
tower_of_hanoi(n, source, auxiliary, destination)

Output:


Move disc 1 from A to C
Move disc 2 from A to B
Move disc 1 from C to B
Move disc 3 from A to C
Move disc 1 from B to A
Move disc 2 from B to C
Move disc 1 from A to C
In the given example, the program prints the sequence of moves required to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem for 3 discs. Each line represents a move where a disc is moved from one pole to another. The output shows the steps to achieve the goal while satisfying the given constraints.
