/*
 AIM: Create class Savings Account. Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual 
 interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable 
 savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide method 
 calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the savingsBalance by 
 annualInterestRate divided by 12, this interest should be added to savings Balance. Provide a static 
 method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value. Write a program to test class
 SavingsAccount3. Instantiate two savingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and 
 $3000.00, respectively. Set annualConcentration Rate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print 
 the new balances for both savers. Then set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest
 and print the new balances for both savers.
